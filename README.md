## Context

Many of the seemingly fancy apps on the web have functionality that can be reduced to just 4 simple operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (or CRUD for short). At their core, they are really just ways to perform these operations on some resource.

- Writing a new tweet on Twitter? That's a _create_ operation.
- Searching for photos tagged with `#kittenmittens` on Instagram? That's a _read_ operation.
- Editing your profile information on LinkedIn? That's an _update_ operation.
- Removing that 2am rant-post from Facebook? That's a _delete_ operation.

Like the steel frame of a skyscraper, _CRUD_ is the skeleton around which web applications are built: it's not very sexy, but you have to know how to do it.

In this goal, we will be applying the CRUD pattern to the real-world system of a bookstore.

## Specifications

- [x] Books have a title, author, and genre
- [ ] Users can...
  - [ ] Add books into the bookstore system via an admin page (_create_)
  - [x] See a list of books on the home page (_read_)
  - [ ] Edit a book's title, author, or genre (_update_)
  - [ ] Delete a book from the bookstore (_delete_)
  - [ ] Search for books by title OR by author OR by genre (_read_)
  - [ ] View book details on a book detail page (_read_)
- [ ] Lists of books are always paginated in groups of 10
- [ ] Book detail view is linked to from the listing and search pages
- [ ] Search results are presented in a new page
- [ ] Appropriate HTTP verbs are used for CRUD actions
  - [x] `GET` requests are only used for _read_ actions
  - [ ] `POST` requests are only used for _create_ actions
  - [ ] `PUT` or `PATCH` requests are only used for _update_ actions
  - [ ] `DELETE` requests are only used for _delete_ actions
- [ ] All views are rendered on the server using server-side templates written with [Pug][] or [EJS][]
- [x] Web server can be started with the command `npm start`
- [ ] Test suite can be run with the command `npm test`
- [x] All code submissions are peer reviewed via GitHub PR by at least one other member of the team
- [x] Master is always in a stable state (tests passing, site functions)
- [x] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

### Stretch

- [ ] App is deployed and live on the web (consider using Heroku)
- [ ] All source code is written with ES6
- [ ] Users have their own account and can sign up and log in/out
- [ ] Users have one of three roles: `admin`, `clerk`, `reader`
  - [ ] Users with role `reader` can only view and search for books
  - [ ] Users with role `clerk` can edit books in addition to viewing/searching
  - [ ] Users with role `admin` can perform all actions (create, read, update, delete) with books
- [ ] Books have a price, cover image, publisher, and ISBN number

## Quality Rubric

- Code is well formatted without any linting errors [25 points]
- Variables, functions, CSS classes, etc. are meaningfully named\* [50 points]
- Functions are small and serve a single purpose [50 points]
- Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure [50 points]
- Code is reasonably tested with a test suite [50 points]
- Interface is user friendly [25 points]

\* _meaningfully named_ = no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function.
